# TIAger Algorithm

This repository contains the code for the TIAger team's algorithm that was submitted as an entry to the [TIGER](https://tiger.grand-challenge.org/) challenge.
The associated paper for this code can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11943).

Currently this repository takes H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from breast cancer as input and outputs a predicted TILs score for the slide.
This is done by first segmenting the tumour-stroma areas. Following this, the pipeline will generate a bulk tumor segmentation and detect TILs within the stroma of the tumour bulk. Finally, it will determine the proportion of this area that is TILs in order to geenrate a TILs score between 0 and 100.
